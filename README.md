# Music-Genre-Classification
This project uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) to classify music genres based on audio signals from the GTZAN dataset. The models aim to learn genre-specific patterns in the MFCC feature space and achieve accurate music genre predictions.
